# Project Handoff

**Current phase, branch/PR state, verification evidence, known limitations, and next action:** see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md), the single source of truth for volatile project state.

**Repository visibility:** Public. Never commit private candidate records, CVs, application history, contact details, credentials, or secrets.

## Phase 5a implementation

- `src/data/sample-public-opportunities.json` contains synthetic Riot-style roles, the exact 16-field public record shape, `last-seen` statuses, a conspicuously synthetic timestamp, and placeholder posting URLs.
- The shared snapshot validator is used by the frontend loader and sync CLI. The loader prefers the gitignored generated snapshot and falls back only when it is absent; invalid synced data fails closed. The sample fallback is visibly labelled “Sample data - not a real scan”.
- `npm run data:sync -- --from <path|https-url>` validates input before writing the gitignored local snapshot. Read/parse/schema failures preserve the destination. Unit tests use local files, not network requests.
- The discovery workflow stages the public projection in the existing handoff artifact, validates it before persistence, and stores generated data on `discovery-state`, not in the application source tree.
- The explorer preserves the studio cards and filters by studio, role family, title, seniority, country, contract, and freshness. It explains source/derived values, shows snapshot freshness and last-seen uncertainty, and performs no runtime career-site fetches.
- Fit/skill-gap explanations and manual leads remain deferred to Phase 5b until a candidate profile and active browser-vault session exist.

## Review boundary

- Consult [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) and the current [Phase 5a pull-request checks](https://github.com/hhaitam95/game-industry-outreach-tracker/pull/4/checks) for current verification evidence.
- Keep the merge decision and any live run owner-controlled.
- Discovery remains manual-dispatch-only. No schedule, publication, Pages deployment, or repository visibility change is approved.

## Engineering workflow

Before each phase and each cohesive implementation unit, publish a short uniquely numbered design note and a definition of done before code. Follow the standards in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md); after implementation, record deviations and why. Keep volatile status and check evidence in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) only.

## Safety boundaries

No private profile, CV, correspondence, personalized drafts, application history, local database/export, credential, or secret belongs in this public repository or the public discovery projection. Do not force-push, rewrite history, delete branches, or destroy generated state. Treat uncertain source data conservatively and preserve the last known good record.
